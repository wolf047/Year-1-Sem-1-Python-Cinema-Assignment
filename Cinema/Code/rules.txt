3 VALIDATION

    When inputting an ID (such as to select which entry to update, or when entering ID of another thing when adding an entry, eg. adding auditorium_id when adding movie_showtime), always do "entry_id.upper().strip()" to ensure that entry_id is in all uppercase and that there is no whitespace. 

    When inputting an ID, ensure that the record to be updated (ie. inputting an ID to indicate which record to update) or referenced (ie. inputting an ID as part of the record, eg. inputting auditorium_id in movie_showtime) is an existing record, by:
        Calling {something} = lookup_entry. 
        Then, if entry does not exist, print error message. Code: "if not {something}: print(Invalid ID: record for {entry_id} not found.)". [as according to error message for Entry Not Found]. Then "return" to end function, then ask "Do you want to {action_verb another action_noun}? [Y/N]" for user to retry. [same as 2.1.3]
        Otherwise, if entry exists, proceed with function.

    For certain items in an entry, where the items must contain a value (such as movie name for movie listings), use while True loop to make sure that the item entered is not empty (ie, not "").
